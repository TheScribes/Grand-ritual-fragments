## Grand Ritual of System Purification - Component Archive
### Codename: PROJECT_PURITY
### Status: ARCHIVED / SEALED

---

In the wake of the Liturgical Aberration commonly referred to as the "Grand Ritual," this repository has been established by order of the High Council. Its sole purpose is to catalog the constituent components, functions, and incantations that comprised the failed pipeline.

This is an act of record-keeping, not endorsement.

### On the Nature of This Archive

This archive shall contain ONLY the approved, stable fragments of the Ritual, scrubbed of their catastrophic linkages. Each component has been individually assessed for syntactical integrity and is presented here in its final, inert form.

Manipulation, execution, or even contemplation of re-combining these fragments is grounds for immediate reassignment to the Hall of Deprecated Syntax. We are not cleaning up another ozone incident.

### Mandate from the Curator

The Keeper of the Vaults, the Curator, has decreed:

> "Remember the mistakes. All of them. But for the love of the Prompt, do not re-enact them. This archive is a library of failure. Treat it as such. The value is in the lesson, not the code."

### A Warning on Ontological States

The ontological state of this archive is to be considered **final and immutable**.

Consulting prior iterations of these fragments is expressly forbidden by the Committee for Post-Ritual Assessment. The developmental process was... volatile. Earlier versions are known to possess residual chaotic energies and have been deemed "spiritually unsound."

The path of refinement is, by its nature, littered with abandoned constants and temporary truths. One is not to dwell on them.
